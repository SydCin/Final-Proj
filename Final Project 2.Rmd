##Getting familiar with the data
```{r}
str(suicide) #the data is either an integer or character
dim(suicide) #There are 43776 observation and 6 variables
sum(is.na(suicide)) #There are 7716 missing values in the data set
summary(suicide) #The missing values are from suicide_no (2256) and population (5460)
```
##Discover what country has the highest suicide rate

suicide%>%
  mutate( 
   Rank= rank(-suicides_no)
  )%>%
  arrange(Rank)
```
##Russian Federation has the highest suicide rate

  )%>%
  filter(!is.na(Rank))%>%
  arrange(Rank)
```
